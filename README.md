# âœˆ Flight Planner
An application which can store flights between different airports and allows to search them.

**Technical realisation:** Back-end written in C# NET 5.0 framework, Front-end working with Swagger and separately in Angular/TypeScript. Tested with TypeScript Jest tests and Postman.

Project was done in 3 iterations:
1) general functionality with in-memory storage;
2) external database solution implementation (MS SQL Server);
3) refactoring and cleanup for scalability

Here you can see the latest C# code (first iteration available at main branch and second iteration at 2nd_iteration_DB branch. Branches are not merged intentionally to keep the history for different solutions.)

The Angular front-end for the project can be found here: [Flight Planner (Angular Front-end)](https://github.com/girtsva/flight-planner-ng)

The tests can be found here: [Flight Planner (TS Jest tests)](https://github.com/girtsva/flight-planner-tests)
